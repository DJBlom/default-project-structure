# Default POSIX-Based Project Structure

# Instructions
- The whole project can be build, tested (SCA, Unit, Coverage), Draw Statistics, and Install packages 
  from the root project folder by running the `scripts/Project.sh` script. This script must be run
  from the root project folder, otherwise it will produce an error with instructions.

  REQUIREMENT: Project.sh must be executed from the root project folder. For example,
               running the script should always follow this method: `./scripts/Project.sh -<flag>`

- Run `./scripts/Project.sh -h, --help` to get a overview of possible flags to pass to the
  script to perform various actions on the project, like: build, test (SCA, Unit, Coverage), 
  draw statistics, and install packages.

# Default Thread Setup
- By default, the threads that are created in this project is not bound to a core. What I mean is 
  no thread's affinity is set to run on a specific core of the cpu. Therefore, if you want to let
  each thread run on a specified cpu core you need to modify the `Services.h` class to use the
  two argument constructor of `Api::RealtimeThread` class. The second argument allows you to specify
  the core number on which you want to bind the thread. 

# Run Unit Tests From Vim
- To run unit tests from within vim, you must create and set an environment variable called 
  PROJECT_TEST_DIR = `/path/to/project/test/dir` `echo "PROJECT_TEST_DIR=</path/to/project/test/dir>" Â» ~/.bashrc`
  `source ~/.bashrc`
- Add these two commands to your ~/.vimrc file.
  `autocmd BufWritePost $PROJECT_TEST_DIR/* !sudo -E make -s`
  `autocmd BufWritePost $PROJECT_TEST_DIR/* !sudo -E make -s clean`


# Run Unit Tests Without Vim
- Because the code uses `sched_setscheduler()`, we need to use `sudo -E` when calling make to `preserve` the environment.
  `sudo -E make -s`
